# Project about PlayStation App

It is a software application for iOS and Android devices that allows us to identify connected friends or view progress or compare awards with friends or create a personal profile to display to friends.

In this project we analyzed the PlayStation App application on mobile phones and used UML models.
Each part of the UML elements was detailed with an explanation of the necessary drawings for the models.
The drawings were designed using famous professional drawing tools found on the Internet.

The project was prepared with a team of 4 computer science students.

we hope that our project was useful and interesting for everyone.
